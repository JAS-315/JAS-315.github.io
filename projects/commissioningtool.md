summary: Progressioning of a project for which I designed and programmed the frontend. This is the UI development.
---

I had been tasked with developing the frontend to software that connects with hardware and allows someone to check certain readings, adjust offsets for measuring-hardware based on feedback from an on-site engineer (who was manually confirming measurements), view graphs of the different measuring-hardwares' performance, and adjust thresholds on said graphs as necessary. As the project progressed, features were added, removed, or tweaked, thus my wireframes took on very different forms. I was on a team of two: NAME on the backend and me on the frontend. I created these wireframes in Pencil, and I will cover development and the live User Interface in another entry.

## Version 1
In this phase, we had been given an extra feature, Firmware, that did not make it into subsequent versions, as it was unneccessary and would not add value for the user, as it would simply be extraneous.

At this early stage, trying to visualise how things would come together on the page was important, so we could consider how the user would interact, if there was an appropriate order based on a usual commissioning session, and whether the infomation would be apparent.
